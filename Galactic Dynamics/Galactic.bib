The majority of galaxies with z{$<$}1 are seen to be disklike, whereas most objects with z{$>$}2 appear to be either chaotic or centrally concentrated “blobs.” Such blobs might be the ancestral objects of ellipticals or of galaxy bulges. About 1 / 3 of objects with z{$>$}2 appear to be in the process of merging. The region with 1},
