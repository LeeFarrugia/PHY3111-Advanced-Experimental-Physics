  abstract = {In JointAI, models are estimated in the Bayesian framework, using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) sampling. The sampling is done by the software JAGS (“Just Another Gibbs Sampler”), which performs Gibbs sampling. JointAI pre-processes the data to get it into a form that can be passed to JAGS and writes the JAGS model. The R package rjags is used as an interface to JAGS.}
